## Protocols

Lisk as a part of electron application can use custom protocols.
In the other words You are able to open Lisk desktop application using our custom protocol `lisk`.

:exclamation: Please keep in mind that not all browsers has handling custom protocols handled as default.

#### Basic usage
After installing Lisk on your device you will be able to use `lisk` protocol.
Example: `lisk://wallet`

Everything that comes after `lisk://` is treated as a route so this example will open Lisk app on wallet page.

#### Voting protocol
Makes voting for delegates easier 
`lisk://main/voting/vote?votes=thepool,4miners.net` or `lisk://delegates/vote?votes=thepool,4miners.net`
It will open lisk app and select delegates automatically `thepool` and `4miners.net`

:exclamation: Please keep in mind that We don't use `/main` route anymore but some websites still relay on an old url so We are allowing `/main` in this particular case `main/voting/vote`.
