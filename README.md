## Installation

You can download the latest release from [Lisk.com](https://lisk.com/wallet). The link automatically detects your operating system and downloads the correct app. Currently we are supporting the following operating systems:

- MacOS (individual builds for Apple Silicon and Intel chips)
- Windows
- Linux

## Development

### Using Commercial Fonts

`Basier Circle` and `Gilroy` used in the production version are commercial fonts. This repository only contains open fonts and uses `Open Sans` as a replacement for the commercial ones.

If you have licensed copies of `Basier Circle` and `Gilroy`, you can add them to [fonts folder](./src/assets/fonts). If you don't have the fonts, you need to remove lines 25 - 81 of [type.css](./src/components/app/type.css). After that, the `build` and `dev` npm scripts run without any errors.

### Setup environment

The development environment currently depends on [Node.js version 16 (lts/gallium)](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/). The below instructions assume [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is being used to manage Node.js versions.

_Note_:
For _Windows_ users, make sure to set the correct [msvs_version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp#on-windows) config for installing and packing the Lisk Desktop application.

```
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-desktop.git
cd lisk-desktop
nvm install lts/erbium
npm ci
npm run dev
```

### Run on browser

Open http://localhost:8080

If you are actively developing in a specific route, and want to be automatically signed in every time you reload the page, please add the following input pairs to your localStorage:

_loginKey_: _a valid passphrase_

Add the above pair using the storage tab in your dev tools or via JavaScript command:

```
localStorage.setItem('loginKey', 'wagon stock borrow episode laundry kitten salute link globe zero feed marble') // desired account passphrase
```

When developing with hardware wallet, this will sign you in using the first account on the first connected hardware wallet:

```
localStorage.setItem('hwWalletAutoLogin', true);
```

You can use the same approach to define a desired network to which Lisk Desktop connects:

```
localStorage.setItem('liskServiceUrl', 'http://localhost:4000') // desired node to log in into
```

### Build

#### Production build

To build the project simply run

```
npm run build
```

Under the hood, this script runs

```
npm run build:prod
```

to build the React app under `src/` and

```
npm run build:electron
```

to build the electron app under `app/` using webpack. You can run the above scripts individually if you're looking to see the changes solely on one of the two said applications.

### Run Electron

If you have already built the application as described above, you can launch Electron using

```
npm run start
```

#### Run with parameters

To launch a version which supports hardware wallets, you can run

```
npm run dev:hw
```

or to launch electron and receive live updates from already running `webpack-dev-server` on port `8080` and you can run

```
LISK_DESKTOP_URL="http://localhost:8080" DEBUG=true npm run start
```

This comes with Redux dev tools.

### Distribution

#### Windows

Build package for Windows (on Windows in [Git BASH](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)).

```
npm run pack:win
```

#### macOS

Build package for macOS (on macOs)

```
npm run pack
```

#### Linux

Build package for Linux (on Linux).

```
npm run pack
```

## Testing

### Unit tests

#### Single run

```
npm run test
```

#### Run each time a file changes

```
npm run test:live
```

### E2E tests

In order to run e2e tests you need to install [lisk-core](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core) as well as [lisk-service](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-service).

#### Setup Lisk Core

Setup a lisk test node as described in Preparing Node headline under [the tests section of Lisk Framework README](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk/tree/development/framework).

#### Setup Service

Run Lisk Service against an already running local node as described in Preparing Node headline under [the installation section of Lisk Service README](https://github.com/liskhq/lisk-service#installation).

#### Run

Start the development version of Lisk:

```
npm run dev
```

Apply blockchain snapshot

```
./test/e2e-test-setup.sh ~/git/lisk/
```

(replace `~/git/lisk/` with your path to lisk core)

Run e2e tests

```
npm run cypress:run
```

### React Storybook

To launch storybook sandbox with components run

```
npm run storybook
```

and navigate to

http://localhost:6006/
